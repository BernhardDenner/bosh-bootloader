## Why?

This directory is now here to help with the usage of [packr2](https://godoc.org/github.com/gobuffalo/packr/v2)

When building the actual bbl binary, this is where your jumpbox /
bosh deployment repos should end up so they can be included in the
final build.

## What happens if this directory isn't empty

Whatever jumpbox / bosh deployment repos you have residing in this
directory will be built into the bbl. Use caution.
